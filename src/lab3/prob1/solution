It happen due to:
we do have separate equals method for superclass and subclass and since that method is also implemented using instance of
strategy. so in case of the superclass object it's going to work fine because the subclass is instance of superclass.
but it doesn't work vice versa since the subclass has it's own equal method not only checks the name but also salary but
it return false immediately after check is instance condition since person is not instance of person with job.
